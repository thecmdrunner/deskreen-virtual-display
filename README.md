# 1. Virtual Display Output

Deskreen can share any display as long as it is detected via `xrandr`, but to be able to have a display show up exlusively on a secondary device, there needs to be an unused display output. Most GPUs and laptops have additional display-out ports that can be used. But in my case, I use my TV as a primary display, while casting my laptop's screen to my phone, as my laptop's display doesn't work anymore.

## Add a Virtual Output

The idea is to make the system think that a display is connected to an unused display-out port (HDMI / DVI / DisplayPort) and sharing its contents to our secondary device via Deskreen.

### A. Open up terminal app and enter `xrandr --listmonitors` to check out all available display ports.

The output will be something like this.

```bash
Monitors: 2
 0: +*HDMI-A-0 1920/575x1080/323+0+0  HDMI-A-0
 1: +eDP 1366/344x768/193+1920+0  eDP
```

As you can see, I have total 2 display outputs, `HDMI-A-0` (HDMI Port, which is plugged in) and `eDP` (laptop's primary display, which is currently unused).

`*` means that the display is currently active.

### B. Make existing output virtual:

#### i. Declare Variables:

Open `make-virtual-output.sh` and edit the variables accordingly.

In my case, the values will be:

```bash
# REPLACE THE VALUES WITH YOUR OWN:
v_name=eDP                # Unused output that you want to use for Deskreen
v_width=1366              # Put the max for your display (eg. 1920)
v_height=768              # Put the max for your display (eg. 1080)
v_position=right-of       # Options: right-of | left-of | above | below 
current_output=HDMI-A-0   # Referemce display to use for positioning

# My command will look like: xrandr --output eDP --mode 1366x768 --right-of HDMI-A-0
```

#### ii. Enable display via `xrandr`

Now run the following commands to enable the virtual display.

```bash
chmod +x ./make-virtual-output.sh
./make-virtual-output.sh
```

### C. Verify if the new output is detected in Display Settings

# 2. Easy Part!

Now that all the technical jargon is over, we can finally head to the easy part!

### A. Get your Deskreen working

Go ahead and download [Deskreen](https://deskreen.com) client as a `deb` or `AppImage` file (depending on your system), from their official website.

### B. Connect your secondary device

![Screenshot of Deskreen](https://i.imgur.com/QiG4Bdc.png)

I am using my Android Phone as a secondary device here, but feel free to use any reasonable device with a recent enough browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari)

After opening Deskreen,

<ul><li>If you are using a mobile phone, scan the QR code shown there, which will open a link in the browser</li><li>Or, you can simply enter the URL shown below the QR Code in the browser of another device.</li>

But remember, the link changes when the remote device is disconnected, and you will have to allow the device everytime.

<li>Deskreen will then ask you if you want to allow the device while trying to connect.</li>
 

![Screenshot of Deskreen Sharing Choice](https://i.imgur.com/6cHOP80.png)

<li>From there, choose between sharing an entire screen, or just a specific window.</li>

<li>I am going to share the virtual screen that I just created above!</li>
 

![Screenshot of Deskreen Confirm](https://i.imgur.com/daSl74v.png)

<li>Confirm the choices, or change something if you need to.</li>
 

![Screenshot of Phone Browser](https://i.imgur.com/qtLpHiC.png)

<li>And, Voila! I have my phone as a secondary display for my laptop, which works wirelessly! :D</li>

You can set the quality to `auto` or anywhere from `25-100%`, as well as flip the screen from the ‚öôÔ∏è icon.

But hey, don't close the main Deskreen app, keep it minimized, as it doesn't run in the background and will terminate your running remote displays :)
